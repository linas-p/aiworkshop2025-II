# Set up LLM's calling in Python

1. Check if Ollama is running:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:11434
    ```
2. Create the Python script `call_llm.py` with the following content:
    ```python
    import ollama

    response = ollama.chat(model='llama3.2', messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': 'What is the capital of Lithuania?'
        },
    ])

    print(response['message']['content'])
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python3 call_llm.py
    ```


## Self evaluation task: Textual data deanonymization

1. Let's say we have the data:
```Python
descriptions = np.array([

])
```

2. We would like to create the prompt for the LLM to extract personal infor and deanonymize the data. Let's modify the prompt:
```Python
prompt = """Instruction:
Analyze the following text and perform the following tasks:

YOUR INSTRUCTION HERE

Output Format:
Return a JSON object with the following keys:

"extracted_names": an array of the extracted full names (e.g., ["Alice Smith", "Bob Johnson"]).
"extracted_phones": an array of the extracted phone numbers (e.g., ["555-123-4567"]).
"deanonymised_text": the text with names and phone numbers replaced by <NAME> and <PHONE> respectively.
Example Input Text:
"Alice Smith, known for her work at TechCorp, can be contacted at 555-123-4567. She is a leading engineer."

Example Expected Output:

json
Copy
{
  "extracted_names": ["Alice Smith"],
  "extracted_phones": ["555-123-4567"],
  "deanonymised_text": "<NAME>, known for her work at TechCorp, can be contacted at <PHONE>. She is a leading engineer."
}
Text to Process:

"""
```

3. Write the Python script `deanonymize.py` to extract personal information and deanonymize the data.

Return [README.md](../README.md)
